# CISCO Networking

Basically all you really need is a combination of `?`,`show` and `conf t` and you can do pretty much everything.
No but really here are some commands:

grep but on cisco:
```
show run | sec <pattern>
```
yes you can pipe on cisco, would I do it at any other point then to use `sec`? Absolutely *not*.
